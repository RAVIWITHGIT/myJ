Recursion is a programming technique in which a method calls itself in order to solve a problem. It typically involves breaking down a problem into smaller, more manageable sub-problems. Each call to the method processes part of the problem, and the recursion continues until a base condition is met, at which point the method stops calling itself.


Steps Involved in Recursion
1.Base Case: Define a condition under which the recursion will stop. This prevents infinite loops and eventual stack overflow.
2.Recursive Case: Define how the method calls itself with modified arguments, which should bring it closer to the base case. in sort what work do 
3.Function Call: When the function is called, it performs its task, calls itself for the sub-problem, and eventually aggregates the results.


************************************************* EXAMPLE **********************************************
public class tut1DecreasingOrder {
    
    // Step 1: Base Case
    public static void DecreasingOrder(int n) {
        // If n equals 1, we stop the recursion
        if (n == 1) {
            System.out.print(1 + " ");
            return; // Stops the recursion here
        }

        // Step 2: Recursive Case
        System.out.print(n + " "); // Print the current number
        DecreasingOrder(n - 1); // Call itself with n decreased by 1
    }

    public static void main(String args[]) {
        DecreasingOrder(10); // Step 3: Initial function call
    }
}

Breakdown of Steps
1.Base Case:
     The base case is defined by the condition if (n == 1). When n reaches 1, the method prints 1 and returns, stopping further recursive calls. This prevents an infinite loop and stack overflow.
2.Recursive Case:
     The method prints the current value of n and then calls itself with n - 1. This reduces the problem size with each call, moving towards the base case.
3.Function Call:
     In the main method, the initial call is made with DecreasingOrder(10). This starts the recursion, and the method will print numbers from 10 down to 1.
